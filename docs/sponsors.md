The **Serverless Containers** framework has been developed as part of 
a PhD thesis from the candidate [Jonatan Enes](http://jonatanenes.com/).

This frameworks uses another in-house made framework, 
[BDWatchdog](https://bdwatchdog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
for the resource monitoring requirement, and is in turn used for a 
specific experimentation scenario for the energy control and capping of
containers [more info](http://bdwatchdog.dec.udc.es/energy/index.html).

This PhD thesis is currently being carried out at Universidade da 
Coruña (Spain), in the Computer Architecture group of the Computer 
Engineering department.
